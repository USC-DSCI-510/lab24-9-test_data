                            MY TOUGHEST TRIP                            

                          by Sergeant Reading                           

    An Arctic adventure of a most unusual sort is graphically set
    forth by an officer of the Canadian Mounted Police.

For a good many years I was a member of the Arctic Patrols of the old
Royal Northwest Mounted Police--now called Royal Canadian Mounted
Police--and naturally had my share of the duties assigned that force.
Since resigning from the force and taking up my abode in a city I have
been greatly amused at fiction writers and movie producers’ ideas of the
work of the Mounties; according to those fellows we spent the most of
our time hunting desperate gunmen and rescuing beautiful damsels in
distress. On the toughest trip I ever made I rescued a female, young but
not beautiful--an Eskimo baby, in fact. I will briefly record how it was
brought about.

Most of the trouble which the Mounties have to straighten out in the
Arctic is occasioned by clashes between the white men, who go in to
trade for the furs which milady of civilization deems necessary, and the
natives. But a great deal of our work was straightening up inter-tribal
sex tangles among the Eskimos.

In one such case, to decide which of two natives really owned a certain
native girl, we brought both the men and the woman to our post at Tree
River. Perhaps I had better explain that owing to the fact that the
Eskimos destroy girl babies during years when food is scarce, there is a
great shortage of marriageable girls among these nomads of the North.
Consequently competition for wives is keen, often resulting in killings.

Anyway, after thinking and talking over this particular case for some
time, we found out that neither of the two men really owned this girl;
they had, in fact, stolen her from her rightful husband, belonging to
another tribe. The upshot of it was the males were sentenced to do two
years’ chores apiece at the post, while I was detailed to return the
woman to her lawful husband.

                 *       *       *       *       *

One bright June morning, I loaded up our sailboat with grub for a
six-weeks’ journey, and taking the girl, I set out.

For two weeks I sailed, making slow progress owing to contrary winds.
Then a storm overtook us. I did my best, but it wasn’t good enough--the
storm won and we were washed ashore with the boat.

I am not a writer, so cannot describe an Arctic gale, or the mountainous
waves, and all that. But I can state that when the storm abated and the
sea calmed down, we were left stranded on an island, neither ourselves,
boat nor stores harmed, but fully a quarter of a mile from the water’s
edge.

Things looked pretty serious for me; alone, I could not possibly drag
that heavy boat down to the water. I sat down by the fire and tried to
figure out what to do. Far into the night I sat, while the girl tossed
restlessly in her furs; but I did not pay much attention to her. Finally
I rolled up in my own blankets and slept.

Awakening at dawn, I walked down to the water’s edge to collect
driftwood for a fire--although it was summertime the ice-filled waters
chilled the wind which swept shorewards. Slowly I tramped along, picking
up a piece of wood here, a piece there; then I ran into a piece of pure
luck, although it told a mute tale of tragedy. Rolling and flopping on
the beach I spied an upturned native canoe--a kyak. Caught far from
land, its owner had no doubt perished.

Eagerly I dropped my load, and lugged the frail craft from the water. It
was undamaged. Again picking up the firewood, I hastened back to tell
the girl, Nuttinook, of our good fortune. She smiled rather wanly, I
thought, but assented to the plan I outlined as we ate breakfast, that I
take the boat, which would carry only one, and go for help.

Eagerly I bolted my food, then set about making a snug camp for the
girl. That finished, I packed a two-weeks’ supply of food in the kyak
and constructed a rough two-bladed paddle. By this time it was almost
dark, so I decided to wait until morning before starting. Contentedly I
rolled into my blankets; gone were my fears of being marooned and
starving to death when our grub had run out. But I had not reckoned with
another factor.

Distances in the Arctic are so great that it takes months to make a
patrol, arrests if necessary, and then to return natives to their own
people. The trouble which had led up to my escorting this girl home had
been no exception; eight or nine months had elapsed since the girl had
been stolen from her rightful husband, so perhaps what occurred was only
natural after all, especially in the Arctic where life is elemental in
the extreme.

                 *       *       *       *       *

At daybreak I instinctively awoke, feeling somewhat stiff from sleeping
on the damp ground, but refreshed. I soon had a fire going, then stepped
over to wake the girl. She did not respond to my gentle shaking, but
something moved slightly beneath the furs; then a thin wail trembled out
in the raw air.

I stood frozen in my tracks! I have mushed hundreds of weary miles,
sometimes with “bad men,” often half starved and frozen in patches. But
never have I experienced the cold chill of dread that wail awakened!

Gently I turned back the robes. It was as I feared--the girl had given
birth to a child. Perhaps injured internally during the buffeting we had
received in the gale, the effort had proved too much for her; she was
dead.

But the youngster-- That little beggar was far from dead! It was up to
me to do something. Never before or since have I felt so helpless, but
somehow I must keep that little atom alive until I struck a native camp.
That was the one thought that hammered into my benumbed brain.

Building up the fire, I quickly warmed thoroughly two of the softest
blankets. As tenderly as possible I placed the baby in the center of
them and covered it up. It still kept up a plaintive wailing. Of course
it was hungry.

From my stores I got some evaporated milk. It did not take long to mix a
cupful. In my medicine kit I had an eyedropper. I perforated its rubber
cap, then filled the phial with warm milk. The baby soon had it emptied;
then she fell asleep.

Gazing at the sleeping infant, I envied her calm, for my own mind was in
a turmoil. Then I remembered that perhaps the first duty of a Mountie is
to protect life. I determined to save the baby somehow.

Leaving her sleeping, I composed the corpse of her mother; then, with
furs and blankets, I made a sort of nest on the kyak behind the seat.
Carefully I carried the infant and stowed her away, then I launched the
craft.

                 *       *       *       *       *

The next three days and nights I shall never forget; every two or three
hours the youngster became hungry and I had to light a fire and mix warm
milk. Years of living in the North with men had made me independent of
women, but I would have given a year’s pay to have had a woman to aid me
then! I was fearful lest I handle the tiny mite too roughly. I wanted to
keep it warm, yet I was afraid of suffocating it.

Fortunately, during those three days and nights the sea remained fairly
calm and the craft rode well. In between times of pulling ashore to
light a fire to warm milk, I paddled hard. On the evening of the third
day I reached the tribe to which I had been taking Nuttinook. As eager
natives hurried down to the shore to greet me, I almost hugged them.

Rapidly, with signs and speech, I made them understand. One of them led
me into a gloomy snow hut. In one corner I espied a native woman with a
babe at her breast. When I crawled out again, she had two babes to feed,
but she accepted the extra one cheerfully. Outside, to the wonder of the
watching natives, I turned a few handsprings in the snow. I have never
enjoyed such a sense of relief at duty done!

Then I had to impart the sad news to the husband of Nuttinook: we had
saved his squaw only for her to die in childbirth. A few days later he
and some of his fellows escorted me back to the island to fetch the
young mother’s body.

Two weeks later I returned safely to Tree River, none the worse for my
patrol. But I shall always regard that as my toughest trip because of
the unusual responsibility of looking after a newborn babe.

                 *       *       *       *       *

Several years later Ayunio, the husband of Nuttinook, made a trip to the
post to tell me his little girl was fine and healthy. He also tried to
present me with many fine Arctic fox furs. Unfortunately the regulations
would not allow me to accept them.

And this describes but one of the duties of men of the Arctic Patrols of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A trifle different from most of the
stuff written about the Mounties, I know--none the less it is true.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
